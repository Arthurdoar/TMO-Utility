# TMO-Utility
[Leer en Espa√±ol](README_es.md)

Chrome extension to automatically redirect external domain links from TuMangaOnline to the main viewer of [Zonatmo.com](https://zonatmo.com)

## In a Nutshell
The script applies if the page URL matches the format `https://(any domain)/news/(HexID)/<cascade|paginated> ...`

If it matches the format and the regular expression matches the `HexID`, the window location will be redirected to `https://zonatmo.com/viewer/(HexID)/<current configuration...>`
You must click on the "Cascade" option (button).
